# Character-UI
Blender UI for you rigs

These simple scripts allow you to create very nice and clean looking UI for your characters.

Download the template file to see it in an action. If you are not sure how to set it up refer to the 
[wiki](https://github.com/nextr3d/Character-UI/wiki/Nextr-Rig-UI)
 which covers most of the options.


 ### Debugger

 The other script is another UI which helps you to build the main UI. It requires no set up and it should help you with for example the structure of the blend file, adding attributes or naming rig layers.

 For more in depth look refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/nextr3d/Character-UI/wiki/Nextr-Rig-UI-Debugger) .
